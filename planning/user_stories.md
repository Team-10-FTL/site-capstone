# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

University students pursuing Computer Science often want to contribute to open-source software (OSS) to gain real-world experience and apply course concepts. However, existing tools require users to sift through long lists or read unfamiliar codebases, making it difficult to evaluate whether a project aligns with their coursework or skill level. There is currently no engaging, intuitive discovery experience tailored to students still exploring their interests or developing their technical confidence.

## User Roles

1. A university-level computer science student who wants to explore and contribute to open-source projects based on their course knowledge and comfort level.
2. Faculty or teaching assistants who want to recommend OSS opportunities to students based on class content.

## User Personas

Persona 1: Maya Delgado
Background: 19-year-old first-year CS major at a public university in California
Tech Access: Mostly uses her phone, occasionally a Chromebook
Motivation: Wants to get involved in CS communities early and build her GitHub profile
Pain Points: Gets overwhelmed by GitHub UI, doesn’t know which projects are beginner-friendly or relevant to her Intro to CS course

Person 2: Marcus Liu
Background: 21-year-old junior at an East Coast university studying CS and Cognitive Science
Tech Access: Uses a MacBook and GitHub regularly for coursework
Motivation: Looking for OSS projects related to AI and social impact to align with his electives and potential senior thesis
Pain Points: Finds it hard to tell if a repo is still active or worth contributing to; annoyed by vague READMEs

Persona 3: Elio Rune
Background: 22-year-old transfer student in her final year of undergrad
Tech Access: Comfortable with Git, uses laptop regularly
Motivation: Wants to boost her resume before applying to jobs, looking for frontend projects tied to Web Dev classes
Pain Points: Struggles to identify which OSS projects have good documentation or mentors willing to help new contributors.

Persona 4: Aisha Bennett
Background: 20-year-old sophomore at a HBCU in Georgia
Tech Access: Mainly uses phone for browsing and laptop for coursework
Motivation: Exploring various tech domains, still unsure about a specialization
Pain Points: Hasn’t contributed to OSS yet, feels most projects assume too much background knowledge

Persona 5: Dr. Helena Reyes
Role: Faculty / Associate Professor of Computer Science
Background: 45 years old, teaches upper-division courses like Algorithms and Software Engineering at a public university in Texas
Tech Access: Primarily uses a desktop and university LMS; uses GitHub when collaborating with grad students
Motivation: Wants her students to connect theory with practice and start building their public portfolios before graduation
Pain Points: Struggles to find vetted OSS examples that align with class topics; overwhelmed by the sheer number of repositories on GitHub. Worries that students waste time on projects that are inactive or unstructured.

Persona 6: Jabril Washington
Role: Graduate Teaching Assistant for Intro to Web Development
Background: 26-year-old master’s student in CS at a large state university
Tech Access: Heavy GitHub user, manages private repos for grading and labs
Motivation: Wants to bridge the gap between classroom assignments and real-world OSS; helps freshmen gain practical exposure to teamwork and real-world tools
Pain Points: Students often ask him where to find projects to work on, but he doesn’t have time to dig through GitHub to verify what’s beginner-friendly or well-documented

## User Stories

1. As a student contributor, I want to select my interests and skill level during onboarding, so that I receive OSS suggestions that align with what I want to learn and already know.
2. As a student exploring different CS paths, I want to browse OSS projects in a fun, swipe-based format, so that I can discover opportunities without feeling overwhelmed.
3. As a first-year or unsure student, I want to see simplified project summaries and course-aligned tags such as “Intro to Python basics” so that I can quickly understand what a project is about and how it connects to my classes.
4. As a student contributor, I want to view OSS projects with a visible star count and tech stack, so that I can gauge a project’s popularity and relevance.
5. As a confident or advanced student, I want recommendations that still challenge me but remain approachable, so that I stay engaged and continue growing as a future dev.
6. As a student building my resume, I want to find projects with active maintainers and good first issues, so that I can genuinely learn and develop technical skills that stick.
7. As a student with a rough experience prior, I want indicators that a project is beginner-friendly and welcoming, so that I feel safe trying again.
8. As a TA or instructor, I want to recommend OSS projects that align with our course material, so that students can apply what they learn in class to real-world code.
9. As a SWE professional, I want students to easily understand my project’s purpose and contribution pathways, so that contributing feels less “scary.”
10. As a student contributor, I want to filter out OSS projects that are “too advanced” or unrelated to course materials, so that future suggestions are more tailored to my needs.
