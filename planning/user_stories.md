# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Jaqueline Jurado, Taliyah Harvey, Nathan Kenmognie**

## Problem Statement

University students pursuing Computer Science often want to contribute to open-source software (OSS) to gain real-world experience and apply course concepts. However, existing tools require users to sift through long lists or read unfamiliar codebases, making it difficult to evaluate whether a project aligns with their coursework or skill level. There is currently no engaging, intuitive discovery experience tailored to students still exploring their interests or developing their technical confidence.

## User Roles

1. A university-level computer science student who wants to explore and contribute to open-source projects based on their course knowledge and comfort level.
2. Faculty or teaching assistants who want to recommend OSS opportunities to students based on class content.

- **Motivation**: Exploring different tech domains; still deciding on a specialization  
- **Pain Points**: Hasn’t contributed to OSS yet; feels many projects assume too much technical background  

---

### 👩‍🏫 Persona 5: Dr. Helena Reyes  
- **Role**: Faculty / Associate Professor of Computer Science  
- **Background**: 45 years old; teaches Algorithms and Software Engineering at a public university in Texas  
- **Tech Access**: Primarily uses desktop and university LMS; uses GitHub to collaborate with graduate students  
- **Motivation**: Wants students to connect theory with real-world practice and build public portfolios  
- **Pain Points**: Overwhelmed by the number of OSS repos; difficult to identify quality, course-relevant, active projects  

---

### 👨🏽‍💻 Persona 6: Jabril Washington  
- **Role**: Graduate Teaching Assistant for Intro to Web Development  
- **Background**: 26-year-old CS master’s student at a large state university  
- **Tech Access**: Experienced GitHub user; manages lab repos and grades assignments  
- **Motivation**: Wants to guide students toward OSS contributions that build confidence and skills  
- **Pain Points**: Frequently asked for OSS recommendations but lacks time to verify if projects are beginner-friendly or active

  
## User Stories

1. As a student contributor, I want to select my interests and skill level during onboarding, so that I receive OSS suggestions that align with what I want to learn and already know.
2. As a student exploring different CS paths, I want to browse OSS projects in a fun, swipe-based format, so that I can discover opportunities without feeling overwhelmed.
3. As a first-year or unsure student, I want to see simplified project summaries and course-aligned tags such as “Intro to Python basics” so that I can quickly understand what a project is about and how it connects to my classes.
4. As a student contributor, I want to view OSS projects with a visible star count and tech stack, so that I can gauge a project’s popularity and relevance.
5. As a confident or advanced student, I want recommendations that still challenge me but remain approachable, so that I stay engaged and continue growing as a future dev.
6. As a student building my resume, I want to find projects with active maintainers and good first issues, so that I can genuinely learn and develop technical skills that stick.
7. As a student with a rough experience prior, I want indicators that a project is beginner-friendly and welcoming, so that I feel safe trying again.
8. As a TA or instructor, I want to recommend OSS projects that align with our course material, so that students can apply what they learn in class to real-world code.
9. As a SWE professional, I want students to easily understand my project’s purpose and contribution pathways, so that contributing feels less “scary.”
10. As a student contributor, I want to filter out OSS projects that are “too advanced” or unrelated to course materials, so that future suggestions are more tailored to my needs.
