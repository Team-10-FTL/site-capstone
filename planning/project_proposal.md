## Problem Statement

The lack of a comprehensive and efficient travel planning solution has led to significant inefficiencies and frustrations for travelers. Existing methods, such as relying on multiple websites, guidebooks, and recommendations from friends, often result in time-consuming and overwhelming experiences. Additionally, the absence of personalized itineraries tailored to individual preferences and constraints further compounds the problem, leading to suboptimal travel experiences.

This highlights the need for a modern, user-friendly travel planning app that can address these challenges and provide a seamless and enjoyable travel planning experience.

Target audience- Users planning to travel

## Description

Our purpose is to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that serves as a one-stop solution for all travel needs. The platform will allow users to effortlessly book hotel accommodations, plan and schedule events, and access real-time flight status updates. It will feature a comprehensive city guide to highlight local attractions and activities, ensuring tourists can make the most of their visit. A unique component of our platform will be its ability to enable users to set and manage a travel budget, providing them with a cost-effective, stress-free travel experience. 

Users will navigate our website to set travel dates, destination, and budget, prompting personalized suggestions for hotels, flights, and local events. They can track flights, browse and book accommodations and events, explore recommended attractions, and manage travel expenses. 

## Expected Features List

Account Creation: Allow users to create an account and have account details stored in the database.

Login/out: Allow existing users to log in/out of their accounts.

Filter Feature: This allows the user to filter through specific categories based on a variety of things such as budget, location, vacancy, etc

Search Feature: A search feature for users to find hotels, flights, events, and tourist attractions based on various parameters like location, date, budget, etc.

Flight Tracker Feature: Can track your flight in real time and provide you with information about delays, location of the flight, etc

## Related Work


Expedia, Google Flights

Our project will differ from those services in the following ways:

- It will provide real-time flight tracking information *in addition* to storing a userâ€™s     
  itinerary. Neither Google Flights nor Expedia offer this.
  
- Provide users with tourist recommendations at their destination
  It is personalized and you can save and store hotels/flights/events to browse later.
  
- A personalized budget management system to make sure users stay within their budget

## Open Questions

We need to identify appropriate APIs for real-time flight tracking, hotel reservations, and city-specific tourist attraction data.

We need to research how we can create our wireframe to enhance user-friendliness and efficiency by strategically positioning key elements for ease of navigation.

We need to research what color schemes are more appealing to users and how to craft a universally accessible design, we aspire to ensure our platform is both visually engaging and user-centric.
