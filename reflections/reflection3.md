## Reflection Questions

* What is one thing you accomplished this week?
  
  We were able to incorporate (GitHub) Model Context Protocol into a front facing chatbot! We were also able to incorporate search functionality, tweak UI, and deploy successfully.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We faced a learning curve when incorporating the GitHub MCP server, especially with the tool definitions, prompting, transport method, and websocket connection. There were also several challenges regarding Clerk and deployment, leading us to eventually cut Clerk and use local authentication with bcrypt instead.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Given that this week was dedicated to only stretch features, we had plenty lining up our Trello board. That being said, we did not finish all the stretch features but that is okay! We are happy with the features we have implemented by the end of the sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Resources like the instructors and advisors were super helpful, especially regarding version control and bugs. We have so much support from the Salesforce ecosystem as well - for example, we had so much help when it came to incorporating MCP!

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The feature "at risk" right now is likely the chatbot on deployment because it makes live AI calls and we can run out of tokens if it gets deployed and people overuse it.
