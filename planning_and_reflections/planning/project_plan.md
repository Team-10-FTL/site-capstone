## Problem Statement and Description

The lack of a comprehensive and efficient travel planning solution has led to significant inefficiencies and frustrations for travelers. Existing methods, such as relying on multiple websites, guidebooks, and recommendations from friends, often result in time-consuming and overwhelming experiences. Additionally, the absence of personalized itineraries tailored to individual preferences and constraints further compounds the problem, leading to suboptimal travel experiences.

This highlights the need for a modern, user-friendly travel planning app that can address these challenges and provide a seamless and enjoyable travel planning experience.

Target audience- Users planning to travel
